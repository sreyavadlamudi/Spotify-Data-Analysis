Description: Analysis using regression in order to figure out which factors contribute the most to a song's popularity and success.

Note: Code is included within the pdf provided.

Process:
  Project creation: My partner and I are both interested in music analytics or anything related to the entertainment field, so we knew that this was the path that we were leaning towards. As two people who use Spotify a lot in their daily lives, we wanted to understand what allows certain songs to be more popular than other. Therefore, we chose to study the trends and factors taht contribute to this popularity.
  We found datasets that showed us different artists as well as different factors that contribute to a songs popularity and then compared our outcomes with another dataset from another artist to see if our findings were accurate. This can be seen in the slideshow presentation along with the results received from the project.
